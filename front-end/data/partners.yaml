        overview: >
            Through conversations with school leadership and review of school improvement plans, the CIS affiliate, site coordinator and their school support team work to align goals that best meet the needs of the students, avoiding duplication and overlap of supports. When site coordinators actually begin providing supports, they collaborate with community partners and businesses to recruit volunteers for tutoring programs, build up clothing closets with support from local businesses or connect struggling families with much-needed medical attention – just to name a few.

        overview: >
            E-Mentoring at iCouldBe is a journey that starts with students in public high schools across the US who select their 
            own mentors, professionals working in careers that the students may want to pursue, and definitely want to learn more 
            about. iCouldBe is embedded into existing classrooms, where one class period per week, students work on e-mentoring 
            activities that focus on academic success strategies, career exploration, and post-secondary educational exploration 
            and planning.

            Find Your Calling helps answer the question, what do you want to do when you grow up? Our mission is to help you 
            (and your parents and teachers) find fantastic careers and the education you need to achieve your goals. Find Your 
            Calling does this through a simple but powerful combination of assessment and data. First, the assessment measures 
            your interests, then you explore detailed data on matching occupations and colleges that offer relevant programs.

        overview: >
            Find Your Calling is an online platform/resource that asks students a series of questions to determine their 
            interests and then matches those interests to colleges, occupations or other avenues. This platform allows 
            students to view jobs outside of their 'comfort zone' and explore local (and non local) colleges/universities 
            at their finger tips.
